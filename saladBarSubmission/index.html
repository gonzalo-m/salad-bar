      <h3>App Description</h3>
      <p>Salad Bar lets you build salads from a selection of restaurants. Build your salad using visual representations of the salad ingredients. Simply drag and drop the ingredients you want on your salad. The app lets you choose from an assortment of ingredients. Select from multiple base ingredients, heaps of toppings and, a bundle of delicious premium ingredients and assorted salad dressings. We have added a feature that lets the user shake the device to let the app build a salad from random ingredients. Once you are done building your salad you can finalize your order by pressing the “place order” button. You are then presented with a confirmation page that has your confirmation number, the date and time of your order and a list of the salads you have built including their ingredients and price. Once the order is ready, you will then receive a notification. 
        <h3>JUnit Testing</h3>
        <p>To test the application’s logic, <a href="https://github.com/gonzalo-m/salad-bar/tree/master/android/SaladBar/app/src/test/java/com/sb/saladbar/model">JUnit tests</a> were written to test the Salad, Order, OrderProcessor and Ingredient classes. These test were run with the code coverage feature from Android Studio.
        <h3>JUnit Testing</h3>
        <h4>Test cases:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If a user tries to check out without adding any ingredients to their salad, a dialog will pop up telling them to do so.</li>
          <li>Maxing out on a certain of ingredients per category should display a dialog to the user that they have maxed out.</li>
          <li>Switching between tabs with added ingredients should remember which items have been added and keep them grayed out when a user returns to that tab.</li>
          <li>Clicking on a grayed out ingredient should be reflected in the salad image, price, and calorie count.</li>
          <li>Scrolling through the ingredients should not allow the accidental dragging of an ingredient.</li>
          <li>Pressing the bag icon should show a screen with the list of salad ingredients and allow the user to place an order or create a new salad.</li>
          <li>Adding a new salad should reset the imageviews of the ingredients (they should not be grayed out), price, and calorie count.</li>
          <li>On the order page, clicking on a salad should give the user an option of deleting the salad.</li>
          <li>Clicking “Place Order” should result in a loading icon and bring the user to the home screen of the app.</li>
          <li>User must choose a base before choosing any other ingredient (a dialog should pop up if they do not).</li>
          <li>User should receive an order confirmation and a notification on their phone once an order has been placed.</li>
        </ul>
